# Controlling RGB LED By PWM ðŸ’¡

Controlling an RGB LED using PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) with Arduino allows you to create various colors by adjusting the brightness of red, green, and blue channels. By varying the PWM signals, you can blend colors and create smooth transitions or effects.

## ðŸ”§ Required Components

- Arduino Uno R3

- RCBG LED RGB

- 220 Î© Resistor

- Breadboard

- Jumper wires

## ðŸ’¡ How It Works

- **RGB LED has 3 color channels** â€“ Red, Green, and Blue pins are controlled individually.

- **Arduino sends PWM signals** â€“ analogWrite() is used to vary voltage (0â€“255) on each pin.

- **Brightness control** â€“ PWM adjusts brightness of each color component.

- **Color mixing** â€“ Combining different brightness levels creates various colors.

- **Smooth effects** â€“ PWM allows for fading, breathing, or dynamic color transitions.
