# ðŸ”¢ Interfacing Keypad with Arduino UNO

**Interfacing Keypad with Arduino UNO** involves detecting which key is pressed by scanning the keypadâ€™s rows and columns. When the user presses a key, the Arduino identifies it and sends the key value to the serial monitor, displaying the input in real time for easy interaction and debugging.

## ðŸ”§ Required Components

- Arduino Uno R3

- Keypad 4x4

- Jumper wires

## ðŸ’¡ How it works

- The keypad is arranged in a matrix of rows and columns.

- Arduino sets column pins as outputs and row pins as inputs (or vice versa).

- Arduino drives each column low one by one and reads the rows to detect a pressed key.

- When a key is pressed, it connects a specific row and column, allowing Arduino to identify the key based on which row reads low when a column is active.

- Once identified, the Arduino sends the corresponding character to the serial monitor for display.

- This scanning repeats continuously to detect multiple or new key presses in real time.

## ðŸ“¦ Applications

- **Password security systems** for door locks or safes.

- **Menu navigation** in embedded devices and control panels.

- **User input** for calculators or numeric data entry.

- **Access control** in automation projects.

- **Interactive projects** like voting machines or quizzes.

- **Home automation** for controlling appliances via keypad commands.

- **Robot control** using manual keypad inputs.
