# Creating Digital Voltmeter using Arduino

Creating a digital voltmeter using Arduino allows us to measure and display voltage levels from analog inputs in real time. It reads voltage using `analogRead()` and converts it into a readable voltage value displayed on a serial monitor or LCD.

## ðŸ’¡ How it works

- **Analog voltage input** â€“ A voltage signal is connected to an analog pin (e.g., A0).

- **Arduino reads analog value** â€“ analogRead() captures values from 0 to 1023 (10-bit).

- **Value is converted to voltage** â€“ The analog value is mapped to 0â€“5V using a formula.

- **Calculated voltage is displayed** â€“ The voltage is shown on Serial Monitor or LCD.

- **Continuous monitoring** â€“ The loop keeps updating the voltage reading in real time.
