# Controlling the brightness of LED using Attiny85 ðŸ’¡

Controlling the brightness of an LED using ATtiny85 and a potentiometer allows real-time dimming based on analog input. The potentiometer sets a voltage level, which the ATtiny85 reads and converts to a PWM signal for the LED.

## ðŸ”§ Required Components

- Coil Cell 3V Battery

- ATtiny

- 250 kÎ© Potentiometer

- 1 kÎ© Resistor

- Green LED

- Breadboard

- Jumper wires

## ðŸ’¡ How It Works
- **Potentiometer varies voltage** â€“ Turning the knob changes voltage between 0â€“5V.

- **ATtiny85 reads analog input** â€“ It uses analogRead() to measure the potentiometer's output.

- **Value is mapped to PWM range** â€“ The analog value (0â€“1023) is scaled to 0â€“255 for PWM.

- **PWM controls LED brightness** â€“ analogWrite() sends a PWM signal to the LED pin.

- **LED dims or brightens** â€“ As the potentiometer turns, brightness changes smoothly.
